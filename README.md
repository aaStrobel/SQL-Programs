# SQL Projects & Data Management and Organization (ANYL 6150) Portfolio üìä

This repository contains a collection of SQL projects and data analytics exercises completed as part of my coursework and personal data science journey. Each project showcases different SQL techniques and data manipulation skills, including data cleaning, complex querying, and relational database design. By applying SQL in real-world scenarios, I've gained hands-on experience in transforming raw data into insights, optimizing queries, and structuring data effectively for analysis.

## üîç Projects Overview
  * **Data Exploration:** Uncover patterns and trends using exploratory data analysis.
  * **Database Design:** Demonstrate relational database modeling with table creation, relationships, and constraints.
  * **Query Optimization:** Improve query performance with indexing, filtering, and joins.
  * **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Use SQL functions to clean and prepare data for further analysis.
  * **Advanced SQL:** Implement stored procedures, views, and complex joins.

## Each project includes:
  * A README file with project objectives, key queries, and insights.
  * SQL scripts or notebooks with fully commented code.
  * Dataset descriptions and resources for further exploration.

## üåü Highlights
  * **Skills Applied:** Relational database management, query optimization, data wrangling, data visualization.
  * **Tools Used:** SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL), DBeaver, and additional BI tools where relevant.
    
Whether you‚Äôre exploring structured query logic or learning best practices in SQL for data analysis, I hope these projects offer valuable insights and practical examples.
